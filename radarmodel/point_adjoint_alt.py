def adjoint_factory_dec(fun):
    doc = r"""Construct an adjoint point model function.

    This adjoint operation acts as a delay-frequency matched filter
    assuming that the radar operates according to the corresponding
    forward model.

    The arguments specify the parameters of the model and the size of
    input that it should accept. The dtype that the constructed function
    will accept as input is complex with floating point precision equal to
    that of `s`.


    Parameters
    ----------

    s : 1-D ndarray
        Transmitted pulse signal, defining the encoding and length of
        the pulse (by the sample length of the array).

    N : int
        Number of frequency steps, equal to the length of the output's
        first dimension.

    M : int
        Length of the input that the adjoint operation should accept.

    R : int
        Undersampling ratio, the sampling rate of the transmitted signal
        over the sampling rate of the measured signal.


    Returns
    -------

    adjoint : function
        Adjoint operator function that transforms a radar signal `y` into
        delay-frequency components `x`.


    See Also
    --------

    Forward_alt : Corresponding forward model.
    Adjoint : Slightly different adjoint model.


    Notes
    -----

    The returned function implements the equation:

    .. math::

        x[n, p] &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_m (
                    e^{-2 \pi i n (R m - p + L - 1)/N}
                    s^*[R m - p + L - 1]
                    y[m] ) \\
                &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_l (
                    e^{-2 \pi i n l / N}
                    s^*[l]
                    y_R[l + p - (L - 1)] )

    where :math:`y_R` is `y` upsampled by `R` (insert `R`-1 zeros after
    each original element) for input `y` and specified `s`, `N`, `R`, and
    `L` = len(`s`).

    The :math:`1/\sqrt{N}` term is included so that composition with the
    corresponding forward operator is well-scaled in the sense that the
    central diagonal entries of the composed Forward-Adjoint operation
    matrix are equal to the norm of `s`.

    It is necessary to take `N` >= len(`s`) == `L` in order to ensure that
    the operator has a consistent norm (equal to the norm of `s`). In
    addition, computation is faster when `N` is a power of 2 since it
    depends on the FFT algorithm.

        Parameters
        ----------

        y : 1-D ndarray with `shape`=`inshape` and `dtype`=`indtype`
            Complex values representing a measured radar signal (potentially
            as output by the corresponding forward model).


        Returns
        -------

        x : 2-D ndarray with `shape`=`outshape` and `dtype`=`outdtype`
            Delay-frequency matched-filter output, the result of the adjoint
            operation. The first axis indexes frequency, while the second
            indexes delay.


        Attributes
        ----------

        s : 1-D ndarray
            Transmitted pulse signal, defining the encoding and length of
            the pulse (by the sample length of the array).

        N : int
            Number of frequency steps, equal to the length of the output's
            first dimension.

        R : int
            Undersampling ratio, the sampling rate of the transmitted signal
            over the sampling rate of the measured signal.

        freqs : 1-D ndarray
            Normalized frequency index for the first axis of the output,
            equivalent to `np.fft.fftfreq(N, d=1.0)`. To find the Doppler
            frequencies, multiply by the sampling frequency (divide by
            sampling period).

        delays : 1-D ndarray
            Delay index for the second axis of the output, giving the number
            of samples by which each filtered sample is delayed relative to
            the beginning of the input. For output with the same size and
            delay as the input, index with [`delays` >= 0].

        inshape, outshape : tuple
            Tuples giving the shape of the input and output arrays,
            respectively.

        indtype, outdtype : dtype
            Dtypes of the input and output arrays, respectively.
