def forward_factory_dec(fun):
    doc = r"""Construct a point model function.

    This function models a radar scene using a sum of independent point
    scatterers located on a regular grid in delay-frequency space. This
    model is assumed by the typical point target delay-frequency matched
    filter; in fact, they are adjoint operations.

    The arguments specify the parameters of the model and the size of
    input that it should accept. The dtype that the constructed function
    will accept as input is complex with floating point precision equal to
    that of `s`.


    Parameters
    ----------

    s : 1-D ndarray
        Transmitted pulse signal, defining the encoding and length of
        the pulse (by the sample length of the array).

    N : int
        Number of frequency steps, equal to the length of the input's
        first dimension.

    M : int
        Length of the output for the forward operation.

    R : int
        Undersampling ratio, the sampling rate of the transmitted signal
        over the sampling rate of the measured signal.


    Returns
    -------

    forward : function
        Forward operator function that transforms a delay-frequency radar
        scene `x` into a modeled signal `y`.


    See Also
    --------

    Adjoint_alt : Corresponding adjoint model.
    Forward : Slightly different forward model.


    Notes
    -----

    The returned function implements the equation:

    .. math::

        y[m] &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{n,p} (
                                        e^{2 \pi i n (R m - p + L - 1)/N}
                                        s[R m - p + L - 1]
                                        x[n, p] ) \\
             &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{n,l} (
                                        e^{2 \pi i n l / N}
                                        s[l]
                                        x[n, R m - l + L - 1] )

    for input `x` and specified `s`, `N`, `R`, and `L` = len(`s`).

    The :math:`1/\sqrt{N}` term is included so that composition with the
    corresponding adjoint operator is well-scaled in the sense that the
    central diagonal entries of the composed Forward-Adjoint operation
    matrix are equal to the norm of `s`.

    It is necessary to take `N` >= len(`s`) == `L` in order to ensure that
    the operator has a consistent norm (equal to the norm of `s`). In
    addition, computation is faster when `N` is a power of 2 since it
    depends on the FFT algorithm.

        Parameters
        ----------

        x : 2-D ndarray with `shape`=`inshape` and `dtype`=`indtype`
            Complex values giving point target reflectivity and phase at each
            location in delay-frequency space. The first axis indexes
            frequency, while the seconds indexes delay.

            Complex values representing a measured radar signal.


        Attributes
        ----------

        R : int
            Undersampling ratio, the sampling rate of the transmitted signal
            over the sampling rate of the measured signal.

        freqs : 1-D ndarray
            Normalized frequency index for the first axis of the input,
            equivalent to `np.fft.fftfreq(N, d=1.0)`. To find the Doppler
            frequencies, multiply by the sampling frequency (divide by
            sampling period).

        delays : 1-D ndarray
            Delay index for the second axis of the input, giving the number
            of samples by which each filtered sample is delayed relative to
            the beginning of the output.

        inshape, outshape : tuple
            Tuples giving the shape of the input and output arrays,
            respectively.

        indtype, outdtype : dtype
            Dtypes of the input and output arrays, respectively.
