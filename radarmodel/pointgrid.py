def txref_forward_delaytime(s, x, y):
    r"""Calculate partial forward operation of the TX-referenced point model.

    This function models a radar scene using a sum of independent point
    scatterers located on a regular grid in delay-time space. This model is
    equivalent to the delay-frequency model of `txref_forward`; the
    reflectivities `x` are just the inverse DFT of the delay-frequency
    reflectivities used in `txref_forward`. A delay-frequency representation
    is often preferred because it is naturally sparse, but this function is
    still used to calculate the delay-frequency forward model after applying
    the inverse DFT to the reflectivities.

    This function implements the equation:

    .. math::

        y[m] &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_p ( s[R m - p + L - 1]
                                            x[p, R m - p + L - 1] ) \\

                                            x[R m - l + L - 1, n] )

    for inputs `s` and `x`, and constants `L`, `N`, and `R`.


    Parameters
    ----------

    s : 1-D ndarray, length `L`
        Real or complex values giving the transmitted radar signal.

    x : 2-D ndarray, shape (`P`, `N`)
        Complex values giving the reflectivity of the radar target scene
        as a function of delay (first index) and frequency (second index).

    y : 1-D ndarray, length `M` and dtype the same as `x`
        Array for storing the forward model's output, the received radar
        signal. The length `M` must satisfy :math:`P = RM + L - R` for the
        input lengths `L` and `P` and an integer undersampling ratio `R` which
        is inferred from that equality.


    Returns
    -------

    y : 1-D ndarray, length `M` and dtype the same as `x`
        The received radar signal produced by the transmitted signal `s` and
        the target scene reflectivities `x`. Relative to the transmitted
        signal `s`, the output begins at a time index corresponding to the
        time at which the final component of `s` is transmitted.

    Notes

    corresponding adjoint operator is well-scaled in the sense that the
    central diagonal entries of the composed Forward-Adjoint operation
    matrix are equal to the norm of `s`.

    It is necessary to take `N` >= `L` in order to ensure that the operator
    has a consistent norm (equal to the norm of `s`). In addition, computation
    is faster when `N` is a power of 2 since it depends on the FFT algorithm.

    Notes
    -----

    The :math:`1/\sqrt{N}` term is included so that composition with the
    corresponding forward operator is well-scaled in the sense that the
    central diagonal entries of the composed Forward-Adjoint operation
    matrix are equal to the norm of `s`.

    It is necessary to take `N` >= `L` in order to ensure that the operator
    has a consistent norm (equal to the norm of `s`). In addition, computation
    is faster when `nfft` is a power of 2 since it depends on the FFT
    algorithm.

    """Point grid radar model for specified signal dimensions and types.

    The forward and adjoint operations of the model are evaluated by calling
    the `forward`, `adjoint_x`, and `adjoint_s` methods.

    The function of this class is to increase the speed of repeated
    calculations of the model operations by specifying the problem dimensions
    and precision beforehand. Doing this makes it possible to reserve memory
    for intermediate calculations and create plans for the required FFTs.

    delays : 1-D ndarray
        Delay index for the first axis of the target scene reflectivities

        Normalized frequency index for the second axis of the target scene
        reflectivities (input to the forward operation and output of the
        adjoint operation). This is equivalent to ``np.fft.fftfreq(N, d=1.0)``
